The shipper must be enrolled for this by a particular reference type like ‘PO’ (purchase order).Then any package order create on the same day going to the same place that has the reference number will get grouped into GMPS relationships.<br>OUTBOUND_LINK_TO_RETURN: is an RTRN relationship.Same concept as an MPS.the OUTBOUND_LINK_TO_RETURN is the Master outbound package tracking number, that when tracked with this indicator you can get all the child return pieces.
