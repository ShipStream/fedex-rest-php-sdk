FedEx SDK for PHP
----


This is an PHP SDK for interacting with [FedEx's REST APIs](https://developer.fedex.com/api/en-us/catalog.html), autogenerated from FedEx's OpenAPI models (with quite a bit of model refactoring) and built on top of [Saloon](https://github.com/saloonphp/saloon).

## Installation

`composer require shipstream/fedex-php-sdk`

## Quickstart

The `FedEx` class is the jumping-off point for accessing all segments of the FedEx API. To get started, instantiate an instance of the FedEx class with your client ID and secret key:

```php
use ShipStream\FedEx\FedEx;

$connector = new FedEx(
    clientId: 'asdf1234.....',
    clientSecret: 'qwertyuiop1234567890.....'
);
```

To access a particular set of endpoints, get an instance of the relevant resource collection class from the connector:

```php
$api = $connector->postalCodeValidationV1();

$response = $api->validatePostal(
    new FullSchemaValidatePostal(
        carrierCode: 'FDXG',
        countryCode: 'US',
        stateOrProvinceCode: 'NY',
        postalCode: '10001',
        shipDate: '2024-05-20',
    )
);

// To get the raw response JSON:
$json = $response->json();

// To get the response data as a DTO:
$dto = $response->dto();
```

To figure out which DTO(s) need(s) to be passed to a particular endpoint method, use your editor to inspect the method's arguments:

### Configuration options

The `FedEx` class constructor accepts the following arguments:

* `clientId`: The OAuth client ID from the developer console. Required.
* `clientSecret`: The OAuth client secret from the developer console. Required.
* `endpoint`: An `ShipStream\FedEx\Enums\Endpoint` value, either `Endpoint::PROD` or `Endpoint::SANDBOX`. Defaults to `Endpoint::PROD`.
* `childId`: If you're working with child credentials, this is the child's OAuth client ID. Optional.
* `childId`: The corresponding secret key for the child client ID, if one is provided. Optional.
* `proprietaryChild`: Specifies if the child credentials (if any) are for a proprietary parent/child relationship. Default `false`.
